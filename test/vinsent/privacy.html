            European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between
            our group companies and third party service providers and partners, which require all group
            companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European
            Union data protection law. It also includes transferring personal information to third party service
            providers and partners which are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
            By providing your data to us you agree to this transfers taking place.
            No third party providers have access to your data, unless specifically required by law, where you have
            consented with us to do so, or in order to provide our Services to you.

          <p>
            We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business
            need to do so, for example, to provide you with a Service you have requested or to comply with
            applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements. We will for example periodically de-identify unused
            accounts and we regularly review and de-identify unnecessary personal information.
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
            either erase or de-identify it or, if this is not possible - for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives - then we will securely store your personal information and isolate
            it from any further processing until erasure is possible.

            portability of your personal information. Again you may do so by contacting us at

            D. If we are processing your personal information with your consent, you can withdraw your
            consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any
            processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your
            personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
            You may do so by contacting us at vinsent.app@gmail.com.
          </p>

            authority.

            settings to limit the information shared with us. You could also reset your mobile advertising identifier or limit ad
            tracking altogether using the settings on your phone. You could also limit or disable the use of cookies (or similar
            technologies).Should you believe that any personal data we hold on you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the ability
            to request to see this data, rectify it or have it deleted.
            We will respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection
            rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
